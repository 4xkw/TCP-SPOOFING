# <i>TCP Spoofing Example (Educational Purposes)</i>

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to create and send spoofed TCP packets using the Scapy library. The script is designed to help users understand the basics of TCP packet construction, the concept of IP spoofing, and the process of sending network packets.

> <b>Note:</b> This code is for <i>educational purposes only</i>. Unauthorized use of packet spoofing can be illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization to test network security.

## <b>Overview</b>

<i>TCP</i> (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol used in network communication. Unlike UDP, TCP establishes a connection before sending data, ensuring reliable communication. This script demonstrates <b><i>TCP packet spoofing</i></b>, where a packet is sent with a falsified source IP address, typically in the context of **SYN flood attacks** or **other network testing scenarios**.

The goal of this project is to teach how TCP packets are structured, how IP spoofing works, and how to perform network testing in a controlled environment for educational purposes.

## <b>Requirements</b>

- Python 3.x
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/), a powerful Python-based tool for network packet manipulation.

You can install the required library by running:
```bash
pip install scapy
pip install random
pip install time
```
